gRPC bi-directional streaming

This is a gRPC C++ bidirectional streaming example: a simple file server.

Features
2-way asynchronous communication
block data transfer
multiple processing threads (the number of threads is currently hard-coded)
safe memory management
managed file locking
pending request cancellation

Requirements
A C++ compiler with C++14 support
Protobuf
gRPC (needs to be built from source)

How to build
At the moment only cmake is supported.

Typical out-of-source build command sequence:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
How to run
Server app:

./FileExchangeServer [<file> ...]

Files provided on the command line are managed by the server i.e. are available for download.

Client app:

./FileExchangeClient download|upload <file>
